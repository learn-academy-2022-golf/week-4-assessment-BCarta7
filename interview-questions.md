# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: In object-oriented languages, like ruby, all data is considered an instance of a class. I don't have a sufficient answer on how that compares to functional programming at the moment, but I can research it and get back to you with an answer shortly.

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming revolves around objects and their data over functions and logic. Functional programming uses primitive, or immutable, data to perform functions.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: both are numeric data types, but integers are only whole numbers whereas floats include decimal places.

Researched answer: Same answer, adding floats are used for more precise calculations.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: The last line of code in a method is automatically returned, the 'return' keyword is not necessary.

Researched answer: The last line of code in a BLOCK is automatically returned.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is an anonymous function that modifies a parent method.

Researched answer: an anonymous function within a method, enclosed by either {} or a DO and END statement if it spans multiple lines. They can also take arguments.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: values inside a ruby hash are attached to keys. You can access it through the hash name and key using proper syntax, such as "hash_name[:key_name]"

Researched answer: In addition to above, all values in a hash can be accessed as an array of values with syntax "hash_name.values"

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Multiple classes with similar or the same attributes can share the data in those common attributes through a shared 'superclass'

2. RSpec: A testing framework for Ruby that can check the behavior of objects.

3. CRUD: Stands for create, read, update, delete; which are considered the four base functions that any API model can perform.

4. Test-driven development: A method of programming that emphasizes testing and refactoring throughout development.

5. HTTP: Stands for hypertext transfer protocol. Acts as the rules for how data is sent and received between computers and over the web.
